Example: I’m interested in joining Cohort 5: Cohort #5 = Jun-23-2025  - Sep-12-2025 Cohort #6 = Sept-15-2025  - Nov-28-2025 But my OPT/CPT will only allow me to have Start Date = June 23rd and End Date = August 8th. Reason: The university has informed me that they cannot approve the current dates listed in the offer letter, as the internship must conclude before the start of the Fall 2025 semester. According to their guidelines, the final allowable date for the internship is August 8, 2025.. Can I still join a cohort, but not tell my university?  - Can I get in trouble for this situation? Answer: If your CPT/OPT date is within 1 week or so around our cohort date. It’s fine. If it cuts off in the middle of the cohort. We have to move you to the future cohort. Who will pay for services that require pay during the internship? Example - API services or Cloud services for the AI product? Example - Need compute for FineTuning a model? Answer: Our company or the product managers in the same team will cover the cloud and API cost. But we will not cover the computer device cost. I will be traveling to visit my family from the USA to India, China, etc…. Can I use this OPT/CPT work permit for reentry into the USA? Answer: We don’t know, please contact your immigration lawyer. Standard response for CPT/OPT process in the program: For interns' CPT and OPT sponsorship concerns, please follow the steps below: **1. Consult Your School First** Please speak with your school’s international student office to understand their specific requirements for CPT or OPT authorization. They will inform you what documentation or updates are needed from our side (e.g., offer letter, company info, etc.). **2. Offer Letter Timing** We are able to revise your offer letter based on your CPT/OPT dates. However, we ask that your start and end dates align as closely as possible with your assigned cohort timeline. A 1–2 week delay is acceptable if there are processing delays, but please keep us informed and send us any updated dates as soon as possible. **3. E-Verify Requirements** We will also need your information to validate your eligibility to work in the U.S. through the E-Verify system. Please follow the steps here: https://discord.com/channels/1255183088607297729/1283485753782964316/1293422029298471007 Please make sure to send/share your full legal name in your offer letter. - If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask in #visa-sponsorship channel or reach out directly to our support team : Marla.
