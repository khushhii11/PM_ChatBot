{"question": "start date?", "answer": "Based on the provided blocks, the answer to \"start date?\" is:\n\n**Start dates are cohort-based and may vary. The earliest possible start is \"next week\" depending on assessment completion. A specific cohort example (Jun 23 to September 5th) is given, but the exact start date for an individual intern is confirmed in their offer letter. Dates can be adjusted for OPT/CPT compliance with limits (1\u20132 weeks delay acceptable).**\n\n**Primary source:**  \n- **Block 1**: Directly confirms cohort dates (Jun 23 \u2013 Sep 5 example), earliest start (\"next week\" post-assessment), and states the offer letter provides the *exact date*.  \n- **Block 2**: Supports date flexibility for OPT/CPT (e.g., 1\u20132 week delays allowed) and reinforces cohort alignment.  \n\n**Links**:  \n- Block 2 contains an E-Verify Discord link for visa processes, but **no links directly related to start dates**.  \n\n*(Answer distilled from key details in Blocks 1 and 2)*", "feedback": "yes"}
{"question": "What is project timeline?", "answer": "Based on the provided knowledge blocks, no specific definition or details about \"project timeline\" are explicitly mentioned. However, Block 3 contains the most relevant timing information:\n\n   Project timelines correspond directly to the cohort durations: Projects run within the fixed dates of each internship cohort.\n   Example cohort timelines from Block 3:\n       Cohort #5: June 23, 2025 \u2013 September 12, 2025\n       Cohort #6: September 15, 2025 \u2013 November 28, 2025\n   Key Constraint: Start/end dates must align closely with the cohort timeline. Only 1-2 weeks of adjustment is acceptable for visa processing delays. Significant misalignment (e.g., ending over a month early) means being moved to a future cohort (as discussed in the Block 3 Q&A).\n\nSource: The answer is derived from cohort dates and visa policy information found specifically in Block 3.\n\nLinks: No links relevant to the project timeline itself are provided in these blocks.", "feedback": "yes"}
